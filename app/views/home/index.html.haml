%h1 Mizugumo Demo

%p
  This is the demo application for Mizugumo, the gem for unobtrusive JavaScript
  (UJS) and AJAX in Ruby on Rails.   Mizugumo uses NinjaScript by Judson Lester for
  UJS behaviors.   This app demonstrates both the capabilities specifically of
  Mizugumo and the general tools provided by NinjaScript.

  You may

  and run your own local copy of this app, which requires Rails 3.

%h2 Available Sections / Demonstrations

%dl
  %dt= link_to "Products Scaffold", products_path
  %dd
    Simple AJAX controller/scaffold demonstration showing a fully AJAX-capable
    CRUD tool that degrades 100% gracefully in the absence of JS.  This is the same
    format that is generated by Mizugumo's scaffold generator.

  %dt= link_to "Graceful degradation of DELETE, PUT, and POST links", test_path
  %dd
    A page showing how Rails' link_to method works with Mizugumo installed.
    When a method other than GET is passed (i.e. link_to('foo', foo_path, :method => 'delete') ),
    mizugumo's helper will output a form rather than a link, and can handle both text and
    image links.  This allows such links to work whether or not JS is available.
