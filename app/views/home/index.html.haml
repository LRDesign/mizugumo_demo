%h1 Mizugumo Demo

%p
  This is the demo application for Mizugumo, the gem for unobtrusive JavaScript
  (UJS) and AJAX in Ruby on Rails.   Mizugumo uses NinjaScript by Judson Lester for
  UJS behaviors.   This app demonstrates both the capabilities specifically of
  Mizugumo and the general tools provided by NinjaScript.

  You may

  and run your own local copy of this app, which requires Rails 3.

%h2 Available Sections / Demonstrations

%dl
  %dt= link_to "Gracefully-Degrading AJAX Scaffold Demo", products_path
  %dd
    This simple scaffold works as AJAX, but degrades to regular page loads when
    JS isn't available.  This is the same format that is generated by Mizugumo's
    scaffold generator.

  %dt= link_to "Slow Scaffold Demo", slow_products_path
  %dd
    A slow version of the above scaffold to demonstrate NinjaScript's automatic
    "busy overlay" behavior.

  %dt= link_to "Graceful degradation of DELETE, PUT, and POST links", test_path
  %dd
    A page showing how Rails' link_to method works with Mizugumo installed.
    When a method other than GET is passed (i.e. link_to('foo', foo_path, :method => 'delete') ),
    mizugumo's helper will output a form rather than a link, and can handle both text and
    image links.  This allows such links to work whether or not JS is available.

  %dt= link_to "Watermarking Forms", login_path
  %dd
    NinjaScript provides a one-step watermarking tool that uses a %lt;label%gt;'s
    content to supply the watermark, so that non-JS users still get a visible
    indication of the form's content.
