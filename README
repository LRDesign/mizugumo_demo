== Welcome to NinjaHelperDemo

This is the demo and testing project for NinjaHelper, a soon-to-exist Rails
gem that provides integration with NinjaScript and Ruby on Rails in order
to provide a super-simple, seamless, no-extra-labor route to AJAXy Rails
applications that degrade gracefully in the absence of JavaScript.   For
more information on NinjaScript, see:

  https://github.com/LRDesign/NinjaScript
  http://blog.lrdesign.com/2010/10/ninjascript-javascript-so-unobtrusive-youll-never-it-see-coming/

I'm working on it right now - and hoping to have a workable demo up before
I go to bed tonight.   Stay tuned!   -- Evan
