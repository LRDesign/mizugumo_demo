== Welcome to MizugumoDemo

This is the demo and testing project for Mizugumo and NinjaScript.
Mizugum is a gem for Ruby on Rails (>= 3.x) that provides integration with
NinjaScript and Ruby on Rails in order to provide a super-simple, seamless,
no-extra-labor route to AJAXy Rails applications that degrade gracefully
in the absence of JavaScript.

You can see this app running at:
  http://mizugomo-demo.lrdesign.com

You can see the gem in development at:

  https://github.com/LRDesign/Mizugumo

For more information on NinjaScript, see:

== Installing

To run your own copy of this app, clone the repo and then copy config/database.yml.sqlite
to config/database.yml.   That should be enough to run it.

== Contributing

Fork the repo and submit pull requests; y'all know the drill.

If you are working on Mizugumo, make sure your new version of Mizugumo successfully passes all the specs
for it in this demo app before submitting.  The important ones are in spec/views/test.  You can point this
app to your local copy of Mizugumo during development by putting this in Gemfile:

  gem 'mizugumo', :path => 'path/to/your/mizugumo/working/copy'
