== Welcome to MizugumoDemo

This is the demo and testing project for Mizugumo, a soon-to-exist Rails
gem that provides integration with NinjaScript and Ruby on Rails in order
to provide a super-simple, seamless, no-extra-labor route to AJAXy Rails
applications that degrade gracefully in the absence of JavaScript.   For
more information on NinjaScript, see:

You can see the gem in development at:

I am very close to a first release of Mizugumo.  Stay tuned!
